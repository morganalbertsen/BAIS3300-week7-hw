This project was for practicing creating a web form, practicing using different web form features, and using best practice in creating a web form.

My web form conforms to best practices in many ways. One way is that on each survey page I have five questions. This helps break up my longer form into shorter, more manageable pieces for the user. I will also be able to analyze the performance of each page for optimization.

Another way I used best practices in my web form was by using one column. By only using one column, it kept by web form mobile friendly. It also makes my web form more readable.

Next, the order and flow of my web form conforms to best practices. I tried to keep user inputs/questions in an order and flow that went from easiest to hardest or more thought needed. I asked for the user's contact information and other general questions about them first, because that is information they can easily pull and fill out. I kept my free response questions until the end since users might need more time to think about those.

Lastly, I tried to make my web form inclusive to the best of my abilities. I made sure Genders were listed as checkboxes (multi-select), gave users an option to respond with "Prefer not to answer", and made the question as a whole optional to answer. I also ran my HTML code thourgh a Sniffer to make sure my code was up to the standards of WCAG 2.1, level AA, for accesibility. To increase my web form accesibility, I made my font size meet the guidelines for WCAG 2.1, level AA.
